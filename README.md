# NESC-SNESC-Modifications

Important Notes:

**UNINSTALL OLD Cores before Installing NEW ones! I would suggest deleting all OLD Cores, then copying these ones to USER_MODS folder!
videos to help those new to the whole Hakchi/RetroArch scenario, better understand!

**Use the respective RetroArch version designated below, for NESC/SNESC (I will be updating these on a regular basis!)

_km_retroarch_standard_nesc_10_10_17 for NES Classic! 
_km_retroarch_standard_snesc_10_10_17 for SNES Classic!

Things get slightly complicated with NESC/SNESC RetroArchs.  I am using the tried and true method of separating the coding on each, to make
things more organized.  So, install the one for NESC or SNESC, accordingly, and you will be fine!  

Some Cores are designated for use with ONLY NESC or SNESC.  Hence, NESC Filter Hack will not work on SNESC.

**The following may change in revisions to my Core Set, but...for now...

**There are 2 Sets of SNES9X Cores for Standard & No Saves.  The ones with --retroarch can only be installed one at a time, and are meant
only for CANOE Roms!!  You can call out SNES9X usage, by applying --retroarch at the end of the command line for these above mentioned CANOE 
Roms! The ones with no NESC/SNESC designation can be installed 1-2-3 at a time, and command lined, accordingly, and onlywork with standard SNES 
roms, like the ones previously used on the NESC:)

Example Command line: 

/bin/clover-canoe-shvc-wr -rom /usr/share/games/CLV-U-XFJBY/Rock_n__Roll_Racing_(USA).sfrom.7z --volume 100 -rollback-snapshot-period 600 --retroarch

And, for the Standard SNES roms, an example would be:

/bin/snes /usr/share/games/CLV-Z-SQUJF/Rock_n__Roll_Racing_(USA).7z OR

/bin/snes05 /usr/share/games/CLV-Z-SQUJF/Rock_n__Roll_Racing_(USA).7z OR

/bin/snes10 /usr/share/games/CLV-Z-SQUJF/Rock_n__Roll_Racing_(USA).7z

The distinctions between 05/10 in command line, allow dual/tri-usage of SNES9X Cores with Standard SNES roms!

I will be updating the RetroArch Modules, accordingly, to reflect specific changes within the SNES Classic Environment:)
And, of course, I will do videos on many things, to make things easier to understand for all of you guys & gals!!!
